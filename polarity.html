<h1>9: <em><span style="color: green">+.242</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">camera i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period!</mark> <mark class = "pos">picture, control, battery, software it gives great pictures, the controls are easy to use, the battery lasts forever on one single charge, the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing.</mark> <mark class = "pos">photo quality, auto mode i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode.</mark> <mark class = "pos">absolutely breathtaking.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out.</mark> <mark class = "neg">the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon, but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i would recommend a larger compact-flash card, at least 128 mb.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon.</mark></p>
<h1>25: <em><span style="color: green">+.002</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">unresponsiveness the catch with the canon g3 camera, is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots.</mark> <mark class = "pos">prior to the purchase, none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture.</mark> no one told me, but i wanted to tell you. this is not the same thing as a film camera. <mark class = "pos">and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs.</mark> <mark class = "neg">they haven't got all the bugs worked out just yet.</mark> <mark class = "pos">most of the time, my g3 is a well-behaved camera.</mark> <mark class = "neg">but once in a while, i run up against it's major flaw :</mark> <mark class = "neg">delay it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button.</mark> i am not talking milliseconds. picture this : <mark class = "pos">your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board, so you compose the shot and wait for your moment.</mark> when it arrives, you press the shutter release. splash! <mark class = "pos">the moment passes, and then your new g3 camera takes the shot.</mark> <mark class = "neg">perhaps there is a way around this delay.</mark> some feature i could turn on or off, or some attachment i could get. <mark class = "neg">yes, i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay.</mark> <mark class = "pos">yes, i have red-eye off, and yes, i've tried adding a flash.</mark> <mark class = "neg">but after trying many adjustments, the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera.</mark> <mark class = "neg">i own another canon - an eos camera.</mark> it focuses in a snap. <mark class = "pos">dim or bright, it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out, after the tae kwon do kick broke the board.</mark> <mark class = "pos">delay canon's g3 does it consistently.</mark> <mark class = "neg">focus, shoot it feels slow to focus, and unbearably slow to shoot.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i challenge anyone to say it is fast and responsive.</mark> and so i must ask, what are cameras for? <mark class = "neg">what task do they perform?</mark> <mark class = "neg">cameras capture moments.</mark> <mark class = "neg">they stop time.</mark> because once the moment is gone, it is not coming back. <mark class = "pos">the dive, the kick, the blow-out-the-candles moments are, to me, the reason for cameras.</mark> <mark class = "neg">a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want, while these digital cameras all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture.</mark> <mark class = "neg">not all the time, but often enough to be a real problem.</mark> <mark class = "pos">like i said, when the moment is gone, it is gone.</mark> so buy the g3. <mark class = "pos">buy it for fun, for lack of processing, because you want to use iphoto, or whatever.</mark> <mark class = "pos">but do not assume, as i did, that the g3 has the same ability as to stop the moment you choose.</mark> <mark class = "pos">from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos, all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to.</mark> g3 unfortunately, this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted.</p>
<h1>31: <em><span style="color: green">+.126</span></em></h1><p class="indented">this is my first digital camera. <mark class = "pos">camera i am very pleased with it so far.</mark> i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time. <mark class = "pos">this seemed like a really good compromise.</mark> i compared it to the olympus c5050z, the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700. <mark class = "pos">based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews, this one seemed like the best all round deal.</mark> <mark class = "neg">it is not perfect though.</mark> <mark class = "neg">here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :</mark> <mark class = "pos">it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera.</mark> viewfinder you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder. tiff format there is no tiff format. <mark class = "pos">that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw.</mark> <mark class = "pos">to save a picture as raw, you have to have the display on, this seems like a waste of battery power.</mark> <mark class = "neg">lag it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter?</mark> trips.  <mark class = "neg">for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop.</mark> import it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop. <mark class = "pos">i have not spent much time with the included software, so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera i am quite happy with the camera.</mark> <mark class = "pos">manual it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera yes, i recommend it over the competition.</mark></p>
