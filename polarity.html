<h1>16: <em><span style="color: green">+.214</span></em></h1><p class="indented">i bought this last week through amazon. <mark class = "pos">got a great deal from a reputable seller.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera i love this camera.</mark> i am still trying to figure out the may options it has. <mark class = "pos">picture took hundreds of pictures and they were great.</mark> <mark class = "pos">color, picture, white balance great colors, pictures and white balance.</mark> optical zoom has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range. <mark class = "neg">it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for.</mark></p>
<h1>17: <em><span style="color: green">+.024</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">picture maybe it is my lack of experience, but i found shots with this camera very disappointing.</mark> <mark class = "neg">price it was too expensive for the shots that i got.</mark> <mark class = "neg">camera sure it had all the features, but when i tried to shoot a girl's basketball game it just wan't up to the task.</mark> i don't think i was asking too much. <mark class = "pos">any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort.</mark> <mark class = "pos">and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i wanted it to shoot concerts as well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">that meant even less light and just as much action.</mark> sure, i adjusted the film speed to 400. <mark class = "neg">grain the grain was terrible.</mark> next time i set it at 100 and used the flash. <mark class = "pos">flash photo, noise well flash photos are never great, and there was still a lot of noise.</mark> <mark class = "pos">photo when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects weren't moving, the photos were awesome.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera the camera was a marvel.</mark> getting the printer to help output them was another tale. overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do. <mark class = "neg">for simple point and shoot photography, consider a cheaper digital.</mark> <mark class = "neg">you don't need the extra resolution or the cost.</mark> <mark class = "pos">then again a one time use camera may do just as well.</mark> <mark class = "pos">if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality, this will be your camera.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera it is versatile and seems to be one of the best.</mark> me, i am going with a leica minilux . sure. <mark class = "pos">it is less versatile, but i am never disappointed with the output.</mark></p>
<h1>18: <em><span style="color: green">+.052</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment, just so you know my bias.</mark> i have been watching the development of digicams for years, waiting to make my first move. what i really want is a $ 1, 500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses. <mark class = "neg">i figure that is at least three years off, and i am getting impatient.</mark> <mark class = "neg">hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations.</mark> <mark class = "pos">g3 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality, clean images.</mark> <mark class = "neg">lag time, flash the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks, and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash.</mark> <mark class = "pos">as of this writing, technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr.</mark> <mark class = "pos">at least once youve got focus lock, the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second, which from what ive read, is better than just about anything else available.</mark> <mark class = "neg">depth what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8.</mark> <mark class = "pos">once i get focus lock, i can then wait until my restless subject strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus.</mark> <mark class = "neg">now what about the flash problem?</mark> <mark class = "neg">flash relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr, the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh, flat images with ugly hot spots.</mark> <mark class = "pos">external flash hot shoe fortunately, the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash, and fortunately for me, i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera, but i can use my metz, with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4.</mark> <mark class = "pos">for those who have this metz flash and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3, the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c.</mark> <mark class = "pos">in order for this to work, you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself.</mark> <mark class = "neg">flash contrary to what ive read elsewhere, the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes, just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon.</mark> you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync, which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow. <mark class = "neg">then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel, because they are all ignored.</mark> <mark class = "pos">the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash, and most of the time, the exposure is spot on and when it isnt, its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself.</mark> this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing, or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away. <mark class = "pos">unfortunately, the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available, so the first problem cant easily be solved.</mark> <mark class = "pos">the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz .</mark> <mark class = "pos">but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range, the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera.</mark> the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted, enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you. <mark class = "pos">the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine.</mark> <mark class = "neg">software now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf, which gives me 130 raw images, as opposed to 7!</mark> software the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all, but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera. <mark class = "pos">i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information.</mark> maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software, youd see the true, raw image that the camera actually produces. <mark class = "neg">i didnt wait to experiment.</mark> instead, i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in. <mark class = "pos">g3 what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware.</mark> <mark class = "pos">color without any tweaking at all, if the exposure is accurate, the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film, and this is a raw image!</mark> <mark class = "pos">g3, software the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software.</mark> <mark class = "pos">software what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical.</mark> <mark class = "pos">what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality, and then if you want fantasy, you can use photoshop to create it.</mark> image but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera. <mark class = "neg">raw image i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3, and can easily put up with the cameras limitations, because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits.</mark></p>

<h1>42: <em><span style="color: green">+.070</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">i've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year, and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom, more adjustability, a hot shoe for an external flash, and a remote control.</mark> <mark class = "neg">i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3, and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics and the price.</mark> <mark class = "neg">i've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera and so far, i've been very pleased.</mark> <mark class = "neg">there's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330, especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures.</mark> <mark class = "pos">lens, optical zoom the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light, and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer.</mark> <mark class = "pos">lcd the moveable lcd screen is great.</mark> <mark class = "neg">you can take pictures with the camera held above your head, way down, or beside you with no problem, allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself.</mark> <mark class = "pos">remote the tiny remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter, it can also be used to zoom and review pictures.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera, tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor, natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before.</mark> <mark class = "pos">hot shoe flash the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :</mark> <mark class = "neg">i chose the canon speedlite 420.</mark> <mark class = "pos">this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos, red-eye, and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing, almost-natural lighting.</mark> battery i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330, but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : <mark class = "pos">i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery.</mark> <mark class = "neg">battery charging system the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera, but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery.</mark> <mark class = "pos">manual i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority, aperature priority, light metering adjustments, etc., but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting, or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do.</mark> <mark class = "neg">negatives?</mark> <mark class = "pos">highlight i've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330, and the g3 seems to do only slightly better.</mark>  <mark class = "neg">no-off button the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy, and has an awkward, tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera.</mark> <mark class = "pos">body and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic, a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330.</mark> i bought a 512 mb card, which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution. <mark class = "neg">download i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly, but there's no difference in working with the files.</mark> i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images : <mark class = "pos">i can imagine that they'd fill up my ibook's internal memory pretty quickly.</mark> <mark class = "neg">at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe's photoshop elments 2.0 software, and can't praise it highly enough.</mark> <mark class = "pos">if you're investing in a camera at this level, buy this software!</mark> <mark class = "pos">and as i said in my review of the s330, all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers.</mark> <mark class = "neg">the bottom line : if you're serious about your digital photography, or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot, this may be just the camera for you.</mark> but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you'll see the difference in your photos immediately. added 2-24. <mark class = "pos">camera i've now had the camera for two months and i'm even more pleased with it.</mark> <mark class = "neg">i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting.</mark> <mark class = "neg">it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures, especially in mixed-light settings.</mark> <mark class = "pos">if you don't have a gray card, you can use a plain white piece of paper.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting, which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure, then one lighter and one darker.</mark> <mark class = "pos">especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations.</mark> i did buy the telephoto lens . <mark class = "pos">very easy to use.</mark> i'll probably also get the wide-angle now, too. <mark class = "pos">camera, use, photo very comfortable camera, easy to use, and the best digital photos you're going to get at this price.</mark></p>
<h1>43: <em><span style="color: green">+.152</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">g3 i've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it's advertised.</mark> <mark class = "pos">after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717, i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality .</mark> <mark class = "pos">it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life, enthusiast features, external flash capabilities, available storage types, image formats, and more.</mark> <mark class = "pos">this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features.</mark> <mark class = "pos">it can be a point-and-shoot camera, but if you do not intend to " get into " it's finer features, i'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera all-in-all, i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market.</mark></p>
<h1>44: <em><span style="color: green">+.128</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it, and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera.</mark> <mark class = "pos">optic canon's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better.</mark> <mark class = "pos">digital camera simply, the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point.</mark> <mark class = "pos">the canon allows you to change lenses, and it accepts the ibm microdrive, so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage.</mark> <mark class = "pos">for me on the fine resolution setting this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card.</mark> <mark class = "pos">battery life the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i've seen.</mark> <mark class = "pos">look the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking, it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap, and it is a bit slow between shots.</mark> <mark class = "pos">camera even with these shortcomings, i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200.</mark></p>
<h1>45: <em><span style="color: green">+.318</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">camera definetely a great camera.</mark> <mark class = "pos">quality, lens proven canon built quality and lens.</mark> <mark class = "pos">feel feels solid in hand.</mark> <mark class = "pos">weight, camera rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros.</mark></p>
