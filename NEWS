Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch


sentimentr 0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

BUG FIXES

* `get_sentences` converted to lower case too early in the regex parsing,
  resulting in missed sentence boundary detection.  This has been corrected.


NEW FEATURES

* `emoticons` dictionary added.  This is a simple dataset containing common
  emoticons (adapted from [Popular Emoticon List](http://www.lingo2word.com/lists/emoticon_listH.html))

* `replace_emoticon` function added to replace emoticons with word equivalents.

* `get_sentences2` added to allow for users that may want to get sentences from
  text and retain case and non-sentence boundary periods.  This should be
  preferable in such instances where these features are deemed important to the
  analysis at hand.

* `syntax_highlight` added to allow positive/negativ syntax highlighting.

MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

* `plot.sentiment` now used `...` to pass parameters to **syuzhet**'s
  `get_transformed_values`.
