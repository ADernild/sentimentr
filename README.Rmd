**sentimentr** is designed to quickly calculate text polarity sentiment at the sentence level and optionally aggregate by rows or grouping variable(s).

**sentimentr** is a response to my own needs with sentiment detection that were not addressed by the current **R** tools.  My own `polarity` function in the **qdap** package is slower on larger data sets.  It is a dictionary lookup approach that tries to incorporate weighting for valence shifters (negation and amplifiers/deamplifiers).  Matthew Jocker's created the [**syuzhet** ](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2015/02/02/syuzhet/) package that utilizes dictionary lookups for the Bing, NRC, and Afinn methods.  He also utilizes a wrapper for the [Stanford coreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml) which uses much more sophisticated analysis.  Jocker's dictionary methods are fast but are more prone to error in the case of valence shifters.  Jocker's [addressed these critiques](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2015/03/04/some-thoughts-on-annies-thoughts-about-syuzhet/) explaining that the method is good with regard to analyzing general sentiment in a piece of literature.  He points to the accuracy of the Stanford detection as well.  In my own work I need better accuracy than a simple dictionary lookup; something that considers valence shifters yet optimizes speed which the Stanford's parser does not.  This leads to a trade off of speed vs. accuracy.  The equation below describes the dictionary method of **sentimentr** that may give better results than a dictionary approach that does not consider valence shifters but will likely still be less accurate than Stanford's approach.  Simply, **sentimentr** attempts to balance accuracy and speed.


# The Equation 

The equation used by the algorithm to assign value to polarity of each sentence fist utilizes the sentiment dictionary (Hu and Liu, [2004](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/kdd04-revSummary.pdf)) to tag polarized words.  Each paragraph ($p_i = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$) composed of sentences, is broken into element sentences ($s_i,j = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\}$) where $w$ are the words within sentences.  Each sentence ($s_j$) is broken into a an ordered bag of words.  Punctuation is removed with the exception of pause punctuations (commas, colons, semicolons) which are considered a word within the sentence.  I will denote pause words as $cw$ (comma words) for convenience.  We can represent these words as an i,j,k notation as $w_{i,j,k}$.  For example $w_{3,2,5}$ would be the fifth word of the second sentence of the third paragraph.  While I use the term paragraph this merely represent a complete turn of talk.  For example it may be a cell level response in a questionnaire composed of sentences.

The words in each sentence ($w_{i,j,k}$) are searched and compared to a modified version of Hu, M., & Liu, B.'s (2004) dictionary of polarized words. Positive ($w_{i,j,k}^{+}$) and negative ($w_{i,j,k}^{-}$) words are tagged with a $+1$ and $-1$ respectively (or other positive/negative weighting if the user provides the sentiment dictionary).  I will denote polarized words as $pw$ for convenience. These will form a polar cluster ($c_{i,j,l}$) which is a subset of the a sentence ($c_{i,j,l} \subseteq s_i,j$).

The polarized context cluster ($c_{i,j,l}$) of words is pulled from around the polarized word ($pw$) and defaults to 4 words before and two words after $pw$ to be considered as valence shifters.  The cluster can be represented as ($c_{i,j,l} = \{pw_{i,j,k - nb}, ..., pw_{i,j,k} , ..., pw_{i,j,k - na}\}$), where $nb$ & $na$ are the parameters `n.before` and `n.after` set by the user.  The words in this polarized context cluster are tagged as neutral ($w_{i,j,k}^{0}$), negator ($w_{i,j,k}^{n}$),
amplifier ($w_{i,j,k}^{a}$), or de-amplifier ($w_{i,j,k}^{d}$). Neutral words hold no value in the equation but do affect word count ($n$).  Each polarized word is then weighted ($w$) based on the weights from the `polarity_dt` argument and then further weighted by the function and number of the valence shifters directly surrounding the positive or negative word ($pw$).  Pause ($cw$) locations (punctuation that denotes a pause including commas, colons, and semicolons) are indexed and considered in calculating the upper and lower bounds in the polarized context cluster. This is because these marks indicate a change in thought and words prior are not necessarily connected with words after these punctuation marks.  The lower bound of the polarized context cluster is constrained to $\max \{pw_{i,j,k - nb}, 1, \max \{cw_{i,j,k} < pw_{i,j,k}\}\}$ and the upper bound is constrained to $\min \{pw_{i,j,k + na}, w_{i,jn}, \min \{cw_{i,j,k} > pw_{i,j,k}\}\}$ where $w_{i,jn}$ is the number of words in the sentence.

The core value in the cluster, the polarized word is acted upon by valence shifters. Amplifiers increase the polarity by 1.8 (.8 is the default weight ($z$)).  Amplifiers ($w_{i,j,k}^{a}$) become de-amplifiers if the context cluster contains an odd number of negators ($w_{i,j,k}^{n}$).  De-amplifiers work to decrease the polarity.  Negation ($w_{i,j,k}^{n}$) acts on amplifiers/de-amplifiers as discussed but also flip the sign of the polarized word.  Negation is determined by raising $-1$ to the power of the number of negators ($w_{i,j,k}^{n}$) plus $2$.  Simply, this is a result of a belief that two negatives equal a positive, 3 negatives a negative, and so on.

The "but" conjunctions (i.e., 'but', 'however', and 'although') also weight the context cluster.  A but conjunction before the polarized word ($w_{but\,conjunction}, ..., w_{i, j, k}^{p}$) up-weights the cluster by 1 + $z_2 * \{|w_{but\,conjunction}|, ..., w_{i, j, k}^{p}\}$ (.85 is the default weight ($z_2$) where $|w_{but\,conjunction}|$ are the number of but conjunctions before the polarized word).  A but conjunction after the polarized word down-weights the cluster by 1 + $\{w_{i, j, k}^{p}, ..., |w_{but\,conjunction}| * -1\} * z_2$.  This corresponds to the belief that a but makes the next clause of greater values while lowering the value placed on the prior clause.

The researcher may provide a weight ($z$) to be utilized with amplifiers/de-amplifiers (default is $.8$; de-amplifier weight is constrained to $-1$ lower bound).  Last, these weighted context clusters ($c_{i,j,l}$) are summed ($c'_{i,j}$) and divided by the square root of the word count (&radic;$w_{i,jn}$) yielding an unbounded polarity score ($\delta_{i,j}$) for each sentence.


$\delta$<sub>*i**j*</sub> = <em>c</em>'<sub>*i**j*</sub>/&radic;*w*<sub>*i**j**n*</sub>


Where:

$$c'_{i,j} = \sum{((1 + w_{amp} + w_{deamp})\cdot w_{i,j,k}^{p}(-1)^{2 + w_{neg}})}$$

$$w_{amp} = \sum{(w_{neg}\cdot (z \cdot w_{i,j,k}^{a}))}$$

$$w_{deamp} = \max(w_{deamp'}, -1)$$

$$w_{deamp'} = \sum{(z(- w_{neg}\cdot w_{i,j,k}^{a} + w_{i,j,k}^{d}))}$$



$$w_{b} = 1 + z_2 * w_{b'}$$

$$w_{b'} = \sum{(|w_{but\,conjunction}|, ..., w_{i, j, k}^{p}, w_{i, j, k}^{p}, ..., |w_{but\,conjunction}| * -1})$$

$w_{neg}$ = ($\sum{w_{i,j,k}^{n}}$ ) mod 2

To get the mean of all sentences ($s_{i,j}$) within a paragraph ($p_{i}$) simply take the average sentiment score $p_{i,\delta_{i,j}}$ = 1/n $\cdot$ $\sum$ $\delta_{i,j}$.

# Installation

To download the development version of **sentimentr**:

Download the [zip ball](https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/trinker/sentimentr/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or use the **pacman** package to install the development version:

```r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/sentimentr")
```
# Usage

There are two main functions in **sentimentr** with five helper functions summarized in the table below:


| Function         |  Description                                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `sentiment`      | Sentiment at the sentence level                       |
| `sentiment_by`   | Aggregated sentiment by group(s)                      |
| `uncombine`      | Extract sentence level sentiment from  `sentiment_by` |
| `get_sentences`  | Regex based string to sentence parser (or get sentences from `sentiment`/`sentiment_by`)|
| `replace_emoticon`| Replace emoticons with word equivalent               |
| `as_key`         | Coerce a `data.frame` lexicon to a polarity hash key  |
| `highlight`      | Highlight positive/negative sentences as an HTML document |

# Examples

```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(sentimentr)
```

```{r}
mytext <- c(
    'do you like it?  But I hate really bad dogs',
    'I am the best friend.',
    'Do you really like it?  I\'m not a fan'
)
sentiment(mytext)
```

To aggregate by element (column cell or vector element) use `sentiment_by` with `by = NULL`.

```{r}
mytext <- c(
    'do you like it?  But I hate really bad dogs',
    'I am the best friend.',
    'Do you really like it?  I\'m not a fan'
)
sentiment_by(mytext)
```

To aggregate by grouping variables use `sentiment_by` using the `by` argument.

```{r}
(out <- with(presidential_debates_2012, sentiment_by(dialogue, list(person, time))))
```

## Plotting 

### Plotting at Aggregated Sentiment
```{r, warning=FALSE}
plot(out)
```

### Plotting at the Sentence Level

The `plot` method for the class `sentiment` uses **syuzhet**'s `get_transformed_values` combined with **ggplot2** to make a reasonable, smoothed plot for the duration of the text based on percentage, allowing for comparison between plots of different texts.  This plot gives the overall shape of the text's sentiment.  The user can see `syuzhet::get_transformed_values` for more details.

```{r}
plot(uncombine(out))
```


## Annie Swafford's Examples

[Annie Swafford](https://annieswafford.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/syuzhet/) critiqued Jocker's approach to sentiment and gave the following examples of sentences (`ase` for Annie Swafford example).  Here I test each of Jocker's 3 dictionary approaches (Bing, NRC, Afinn), his Stanford wrapper (note I use my own [GitHub Stanford wrapper package](https://github.com/trinker/stansent) based off of Jocker's approach as it works more reliably on  my own Windows machine), and my own algorithm with both the default [Hu & Liu (2004)](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2004/AAAI04-119.pdf) polarity lexicon as well as [Baccianella, Esuli and Sebastiani's (2010)](http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/) SentiWord lexicon.


```{r, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/sentimentr", "trinker/stansent")
pacman::p_load(syuzhet, qdap, microbenchmark)

ase <- c(
    "I haven't been sad in a long time.",
    "I am extremely happy today.",
    "It's a good day.",
    "But suddenly I'm only a little bit happy.",
    "Then I'm not happy at all.",
    "In fact, I am now the least happy person on the planet.",
    "There is no happiness left in me.",
    "Wait, it's returned!",
    "I don't feel so bad after all!"
)

syuzhet <- setNames(as.data.frame(lapply(c("bing", "afinn", "nrc"),
    function(x) get_sentiment(ase, method=x))), c("bing", "afinn", "nrc"))


left_just(data.frame(
    stanford = sentiment_stanford(ase),
    hu_liu = round(sentiment(ase, question.weight = 0)[["sentiment"]], 2),
    sentiword = round(sentiment(ase, sentiword, question.weight = 0)[["sentiment"]], 2),    
    syuzhet,
    sentences = ase,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
), "sentences")

```

Also of interest is the computational time used by each of these methods. To demonstrate this I increased Annie's examples by 100 replications and **microbenchmark** on a few iterations (Stanford takes so long I didn't extend to more).  Note that if a text needs to be broken into sentence parts **syuzhet** has the `get_sentences` function that uses the **openNLP** package, this is a time expensive task. **sentimentr** uses a much faster regex based approach that is nearly as accurate in parsing sentences with a much lower computational time.  We see that Stanford takes the longest time while **sentimentr** and **syuzhet** are comparable depending upon lexicon used.


```{r, message = FALSE, comment=NA}
ase_100 <- rep(ase, 100)

stanford <- function() {sentiment_stanford(ase_100)}

sentimentr_hu_liu <- function() sentiment(ase_100)
sentimentr_sentiword <- function() sentiment(ase_100, sentiword) 
    
syuzhet_binn <- function() get_sentiment(ase_100, method="bing")
syuzhet_nrc <- function() get_sentiment(ase_100, method="nrc")
syuzhet_afinn <- function() get_sentiment(ase_100, method="afinn")
     
microbenchmark(
    stanford(),
    sentimentr_hu_liu(),
    sentimentr_sentiword(),
    syuzhet_binn(), 
    syuzhet_nrc(),
    syuzhet_afinn(),
    times = 3
)
```

## Comparing sentimentr, syuzhet, and Stanford

The accuracy of an algorithm weighs heavily into the decision as to what approach to take in sentiment detection.  Both **syuzhet** and **sentimentr** provide multiple dictionaries with a general algorithm to compute sentiment scores. **syuzhet** provides 3 approaches while **sentimentr** provides 2, but can be extended easily using the 3 dictionaries from the **syuzhet** package.  The follow visualization provides the accuracy of these approaches in comparison to Stanford's **Java** based implementation of sentiment detection.  The visualization is generated from testing on three reviews data sets from Kotzias, Denil, De Freitas, & Smyth (2015).  These authors utilized the three 1000 element data sets from:

- amazon.com
- imdb.com
- yelp.com

The data sets are hand scored as either positive or negative.  The testing here merely matches the sign of the algorithm to the human coded output to determine accuracy rates.

- Kotzias, D., Denil, M., De Freitas, N., & Smyth,P. (2015). *From group to individual labels using deep features*. Proceedings of the 21th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. 597-606. http://mdenil.com/media/papers/2015-deep-multi-instance-learning.pdf

<img src="inst/figure/comparisons_between_sentiment_detectors_b.png" width="100%" alt="sent comp">  

The bar graph on the left shows the accuracy rates for the various sentiment set-ups in the three review contexts.  The rank plot on the right shows how the rankings for the methods varied across the three review contexts (note that rank ties were determined by `ties.method = "first"`).  

The take away here seems that, unsurprisingly, Stanford's algorithm consistently out scores **syuzhet** and **sentimentr**.  The **sentimentr** approach loaded with the `hu_lu` dictionary is a top pick for speed and accuracy.  The `bing` dictionary also performs well within both the **syuzhet** and **sentimentr** algorithms.  Generally, the **sentimentr** algorithm out performs **syuzhet** when their dictonaries are comparable.

It is important to point out that this is a small sample data set that covers a narrow range of uses for sentiment detection.  Jocker's **syuzhet** was designed to be applied across book chunks and it is, to some extent, unfair to test it out of this context.  Still this initial analysis provides a guide that may be of use for selecting the sentiment detection set up most applicable to the reader's needs.

The reader may access the R script used to generate this visual via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
testing <- system.file("sentiment_testing/sentiment_testing.R", package = "sentimentr")
file.copy(testing, getwd())
```

In the figure below we compare raw table counts as a heat map, plotting the predicted values from the various algorithms on the x axis versus the human scored values on the y axis.  

<img src="inst/figure/comparisons_between_sentiment_detectors2.png" width = "80%" alt="sent comp">  

Across all three contexts, notice that the Stanford coreNLP algorithm is better at:

- Detecting negative sentiment as negative
- Discrimination (i.e., reducing neutral assignments)

The Bing, Hu & Lu, and Afinn dictionaries all do well with regard to not assigning negative scores to positive statements, but perform less well in the reverse, often assigning positive scores to negative statements.  We can now see that the reason for the NRC's poorer performance in accuracy rate above is its inability to discriminate.  The Sentiword dictionary does well at discriminating (like Stanford's coreNLP) but does not perform well.  We can deduce to things from this observation:

1. Larger dictionaries discriminate better (Sentiword [n = `r  prettyNum(nrow(sentiword), big.mark=",")`] vs. Hu & Lu [n = `r prettyNum(nrow(polarity_table), big.mark=",")`])
2. The Sentiword dictionary may have words with reversed polarities

A reworking of the Sentiword dictionary may yield better results for a dictionary lookup approach to sentiment detection, potentially, improving on discrimination and accuracy.

The reader may access the R script used to generate this visual via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
testing2 <- system.file("sentiment_testing/raw_results.R", package = "sentimentr")
file.copy(testing2, getwd())
```

## Text Highlighting

The user may wish to see the output from `sentiment_by` line by line with positive/negative sentences highlighted.  The `highlight` function wraps a `sentiment_by` output to produces a highlighted HTML file (positive = green; negative = pink). Here we look at three random reviews from Hu and Liu's (2004) Cannon G3 Camera Amazon product reviews.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2)
highlight(with(subset(cannon_reviews, number %in% sample(unique(number), 3)), sentiment_by(review, number)))
```
