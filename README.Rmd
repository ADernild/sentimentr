**sentimentr** is designed to quickly calulate text polarity sentiment at the sentence level and optionally aggregate by rows or grouping variable(s).

equation used by the algorithm to assign value to polarity of each sentence fist utilizes the sentiment dictionary (Hu and Liu, 2004) to tag polarized words.  A context cluster ($x_i^{T}$) of words is pulled from around this polarized word (default 4 words before and two words after) to be considered as valence shifters.  The words in this context cluster are tagged as neutral ($x_i^{0}$), negator ($x_i^{N}$), amplifier ($x_i^{a}$), or de-amplifier ($x_i^{d}$). Neutral words hold no value in the equation but do affect word count ($n$).  Each polarized word is then weighted $w$ based on the weights from the `polarity_dt` argument and then further weighted by the number and position of the valence shifters directly surrounding the positive or negative word.  The researcher may provide a weight $c$ to be utilized with amplifiers/de-amplifiers (default is .8; deamplifier weight is constrained to -1 lower bound).  Last, these context cluster ($x_i^{T}$) are summed and divided by the square root of the word count ($\sqrt{n}$) yielding an unbounded polarity score ($\delta$).  Note that context clusters containing a comma before the polarized word will only consider words found after the comma.
